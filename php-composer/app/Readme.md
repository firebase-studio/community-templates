# PHP + Composer Template for Project IDX

This is a community template for [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/) that provides a ready-to-use PHP API development environment with Composer for dependency management.

This template builds upon the standard PHP template by including Composer, allowing you to easily manage your project's dependencies.

## What's Included?

*   **PHP**: The latest stable version provided by the IDX environment.
*   **Composer**: The de facto dependency manager for PHP.

To test the service locally, run:

```sh
php -S localhost:3000 index.php
```
